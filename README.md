# DnD-Character-Vault
BETA Version 0.1

This is my first Python program that I have written and the first program since I was in school that I have written. I had a blast writing this program and look forward to more Python and SQL. 

OVERVIEW

The purpose of this program is to create a vault that Dungeons and Dragons players could use to store their characters along with all the appropriate information (stats, inventory, etc.)
This program utilizes database (.db) files to store information with the character database file taking the first name of the character (ex.: soandso.db).
The 'data.db' database contains the information for add items to a character and has been written to be included in the same folder as the main program. 

NEAR FUTURE FIXES

-As written, the program crashes when an item that isn't in the database is entered in. Will indicate invalid selection and cycle back to the menu.
-Some of the text is formatted poorly - will revise to make it easier to read. 
-Add calculation of weapon damage formula and range. This will include adding attribute bonuses and magical bonuses
-Add calculation for actual armor class using culmination of armor, shield, dex bonus, and item bonus.
-Finish the items list. Would like to create a reader for this to speed up the process. 

LONG TERM GOALS

-Add GUI
-Add character vs. monster and character vs. character combat simulation
-Add spells to database. Will need to determine what attributes to pull along will a script for reading all the spells as manually putting the infromation in would take a LONG time.
-Create separate player and GM tools. Not sure how necessary this would be but might be a good exercise in pulling different files into a main program.
